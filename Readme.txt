- A [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) account (for hosting your website)

**No experience needed with:**
- Command lines or terminals
- Programming 
- Web servers
- Databases

**Time needed:** About 30 minutes

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Make sure you're logged into GitHub**
2. **Go to this repository** (the page you're reading this on)
3. **Click the green "Fork" button** at the top right of this page
   - This creates your own copy of the website code
   - You'll see "Forking..." for a few seconds
   - You'll be taken to YOUR copy of the code (notice your username in the URL)
4. **Great!** You now have your own copy of the website code

### Step 5: Create Your Website on PythonAnywhere

**What is this step?** We're telling PythonAnywhere "hey, we want to run a website!"

1. **Go to the "Web" tab** at the top of PythonAnywhere (click it)
2. **Click the big blue "Add a new web app" button**
3. **Choose "Manual configuration"** (NOT Flask!)
4. **Select "Python 3.10"** (or the newest Python version available)
5. **Click "Next"** until you get to a page with your website settings

**You should now see** a page with your website URL at the top (like `yourusername.pythonanywhere.com`)

### Step 3: Upload Your Code to PythonAnywhere

**What is this step?** We need to copy your website code from GitHub to PythonAnywhere (where it will run).

1. **Go to PythonAnywhere and log in**
2. **Look for the "Files" tab** at the top and click it
3. **Look for "Open Bash console here"** (it's a button that looks like `# Content Portfolio Website

 symbol again
   - **If you see any "successfully installed" messages, that's good!**

### Step 6: Tell PythonAnywhere Where Your Website Code Is

**What is this step?** We need to point PythonAnywhere to the code we uploaded.

1. **Make sure you're on the Web tab** (from the previous step)
2. **Scroll down to the "Code" section**
3. **You'll see two boxes to fill in:**

   **For "Source code":** Click in the box and type:
   ```
   /home/yourusername/ContentPortfolio
   ```
   **IMPORTANT:** Replace `yourusername` with YOUR PythonAnywhere username!
   
   **For "Working directory":** Click in the box and type the same thing:
   ```
   /home/yourusername/ContentPortfolio
   ```

4. **Scroll down to "WSGI configuration file"**
5. **Click on the file link** (it looks like `/var/www/yourusername_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py`)
6. **You'll see a text editor with some code**
7. **Select ALL the existing text** (Ctrl+A) and **delete it**
8. **Copy and paste this instead:**
   ```python
   import sys
   import os

   # Add your project directory to the sys.path
   project_home = '/home/yourusername/ContentPortfolio'  # Replace 'yourusername'
   if project_home not in sys.path:
       sys.path = [project_home] + sys.path

   from app import app as application

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       application.run()
   ```
   **CRITICAL:** Change `yourusername` to YOUR actual PythonAnywhere username in that code!

9. **Click the "Save" button** at the top of the editor

### Step 7: Set Up Your Website's Database

**What is this step?** Every website needs a database to store information. We're creating yours now.

1. **Go back to your terminal** (the black window from earlier)
   - If you closed it, go to the "Tasks" tab and click "$ Bash" to open a new one
   - Make sure you're in the ContentPortfolio folder by typing `cd ContentPortfolio` and pressing Enter

2. **Copy and paste this command:**
   ```bash
   python3 init_db.py
   ```
3. **Press Enter**

**You should see messages like:**
```
‚úÖ Database initialized successfully!
üîê Default admin login:
   Username: admin
   Password: changeme123
```

**If you see those messages - great!** Your database is ready.

**If you see error messages:** Don't panic! Scroll down to the "Troubleshooting" section of this guide.

### Step 8: Launch Your Website! üöÄ

**The moment of truth!**

1. **Go back to the "Web" tab** in PythonAnywhere
2. **Look for the big green "Reload" button** and click it
   - This tells PythonAnywhere to start your website
   - You'll see a spinning icon for a few seconds
3. **Click on your website URL** at the top of the page (looks like `yourusername.pythonanywhere.com`)

**If everything worked:** You should see your portfolio website! It will have placeholder content, but it's YOURS and it's live on the internet!

**If you see an error:** Check the troubleshooting section below.

## üîë Logging Into Your Website

**Now let's log in and make it yours!**

1. **On your website, look for a "Login" link** (usually in the top menu)
2. **Click "Login"**
3. **Enter these login details:**
   - **Username:** `admin`
   - **Password:** `changeme123`
4. **Click the login button**

**If login works:** Congratulations! You're now logged into your website as the administrator.

**‚ö†Ô∏è SUPER IMPORTANT:** Change that password immediately! Look for "Settings" or "Account" in your admin area and change the password to something secure.

**If login doesn't work:** Check the troubleshooting section below.

## üé® Making the Website Yours

**Once you're logged in, here's how to customize everything:**

### Changing Your Site Information

1. **Look for "Settings" or "Admin Panel"** in your website navigation
2. **Click on it** to access the customization options
3. **You can change:**
   - Your name and title
   - Site colors and styling
   - About section text
   - Contact information
   - Social media links

### Adding Your Projects

1. **Look for "Add Project" or "Projects"** in your admin area
2. **Click it to add your first project**
3. **For each project, you can add:**
   - Project title and description
   - Images/screenshots
   - Links to live projects
   - Categories (like "Web Design" or "Content Strategy")
   - Business goals (like "Increase Conversions")

### Uploading Images

1. **When adding projects, you can upload images**
2. **Use good quality images** (at least 800px wide works well)
3. **Common formats:** JPG, PNG, GIF

### Making Changes to Your Code

**If you want to modify the website's design or functionality:**

1. **Make changes on your computer** (you'll need to download the code first)
2. **Upload changes back to GitHub:**
   - This requires learning a bit about Git, but there are lots of tutorials online
3. **Update your live website:**
   - Go to PythonAnywhere terminal
   - Type: `cd ContentPortfolio`
   - Type: `git pull origin main`
   - Go to Web tab and click "Reload"

**Don't worry about this advanced stuff at first** - focus on adding your content through the admin panel!
